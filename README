JenScan
========

Javascript Enhanced Network scanner

This is a lan reconnaisance tool, fully running in javascript and 
only employing the Image Object src attribute and subsequent onload 
and onerror event handling.

It aims to be more performant then existing implementations by utilising

+ image lsit optimisation
+ ip list optimisation (todo)
+ time fingerprinting




USAGE
=====
drop the folder on a webserver as a whole and edit the the index.html file to your liking
just include the following two lines

<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">_run();</script>

You might also want to edit settings.js to reflect the target Class C subnet (or replace it with a function that retrieves it



As is now the results are piped to the console of the browser, should you like other reporting options,
alter the function scanner_log() in scanner.js



WARANTY
=======
This code is eperimental and comes without any waranty what so ever.
I did the original development tests on IE9 and further finetuning on Firefox 11.
Should you encounter any issues on these or any other browser version, drop me a line.
