JenScan
========
Javascript Enhanced Network scanner
Created by R.Somers 2012


This is a lan reconnaisance tool, running in javascript and 
only employing the Image Object src attribute and subsequent onload 
and onerror event handling.

It aims to be more performant then existing implementations by utilising

+ image lsit optimisation
+ ip list optimisation (todo)
+ time fingerprinting


USAGE
=====
drop the folder on a webserver as a whole and edit the the index.html file to your liking
just include the following line

<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>

You might also want to edit settings.js to reflect the target Class C subnet (or replace it with a function that retrieves it)



As is now the results are piped to a txtarea fiels, should you like other reporting options (e.g.: sending them back to the server),
alter the function scanner_log() in scanner.js



Should you encounter any issues on these or any other browser version, drop me a line.
