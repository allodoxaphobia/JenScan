JenScan
========

Javascript Enhanced Network scanner

This is a lan reconnaisance tool, fully running in javascript and 
only employing the Image Object src attribute and subsequent onload 
and onerror event handling.

It aims to be more performant then existing implementations by utilising

+ image lsit optimisation
+ ip list optimisation (todo)
+ time fingerprinting




This code is eperimental and comes without any waranty what so ever.
