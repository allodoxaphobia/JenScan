#	UID|device|SCAN Level|recon image|recon_size|triggers_dependency|dependency
#
#	uid : unique id for this entry
#	recon_image: label to return
#	recon_size= height, width set to 0 to ignore size
#	triggers_dependency= set to 1 if you want to load dependant items based on the outcome of the result
#		e.g. an entry with id 25 has triggers_dependency = 1 and its scanresult  = 0
#		the scanner will load all urls for this host with dependency set to !25
#		if the result came back as 1, it would load urls with dpendency=25
#	dependency: add UId of image that should be located on this host before this entry is scanned 
#		   (taken from previous scanround), 
#	     		set to !UID to scan when this entry is missing, leave blank to scan regardless
